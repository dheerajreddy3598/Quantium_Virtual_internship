## Forage Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program

### Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Forage Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program. The program involved analyzing chip purchases at supermarkets to evaluate customer preferences and the performance of trial stores with a new layout. The aim was to provide insights to the client and recommendations on the success of the trial.

### Tasks Completed

#### Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

- Cleaned the data, including converting date formats and removing outliers.
- Analyzed purchase behaviors based on customer attributes like LIFESTAGE and MEMBER_TYPE.
- Investigated preferences of the Mainstream Young Singles/Couples segment regarding chip brand and packet size choices.

#### Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing

- Compared trial stores with potential control stores using metrics like total sales and number of customers.
- Conducted hypothesis testing to determine significant differences in performance between control and trial stores.

#### Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application

- Prepared a PowerPoint report summarizing key insights using the Pyramid Principle.
- Highlighted findings such as the highest contributing customer segments to total sales and the impact of the trial layout on store performance.

### Files

- `QVI_task1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for Task 1.
- `QVI_task2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for Task 2.

### Dependencies

- **Language**: Python 3.8
- **Packages**: pandas, matplotlib, mlxtend, datetime, sklearn, scipy

### Insights

- Identified key customer segments contributing to total sales.
- Determined significant increases in sales and customer numbers for certain trial stores.
- Provided actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

### Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into customer behaviors and the effectiveness of the trial store layout. It demonstrated my ability to analyze data, draw meaningful conclusions, and communicate findings effectively.
For the total sales, store 77 saw a statistically significant increase (above the 95% control threshold) in Mar and Apr while store 86 saw an increase in Mar
For the number of customers, both stores 77 and 86 saw significant increases in at least 2 months
No significant change in performance due to the trial in store 88
Task 3: Analytics and commercial application
Prepared a report in Powerpoint highlighting key insights from Tasks 1 and 2 using the Pyramid Principle
